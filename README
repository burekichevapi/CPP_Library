My C++ library I'm making so I can use for FSU and other projects. 
NOTE: all code is my own, I simply visualized the behavior of each data structure,
I then to write each algorithm for the given procedure. I know it may not be the most
efficent given I did all of this without any prior knowledge of data structure and algo's.
